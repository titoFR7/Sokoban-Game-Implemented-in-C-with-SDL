# Sokoban-Game-Implemented-in-C-with-SDL
This project is an experimental implementation of the classic Sokoban game, developed in C using the SDL2 library. Created by a French student in their second year of a Computer Science degree at the University of Clermont Auvergne (UCA), this game leverages advanced programming concepts while providing a simple and intuitive user experience.
